Scraping Algiers Townships using beautifulsoup and creating a marked folium map:

-BeautifulSoup: Beautiful Soup is a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents (including having malformed markup, i.e. non-closed tags, so named after tag soup). It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data from HTML, which is useful for web scraping.
-Folium: Folium is a Python library used for visualizing geospatial data. It is easy to use and yet a powerful library. Folium is a Python wrapper for Leaflet. js which is a leading open-source JavaScript library for plotting interactive maps. It has the power of Leaflet.
-WebScraping: Extracting data from websites

The goal of this mini project is to extract the data about Algiers Townships(Les Communes-In french-) and get their coordinates (Latitude and longitude) to create a dataframe to be used  to make a marked folium map as part of a data vizualization process .
